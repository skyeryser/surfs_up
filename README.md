# Surfs_Up

## Overview
This project delivers summary statistics for the temperature in Oahu during June and December. The client can use the information presented in this analysis to determine whether a surf and ice cream shop on the island will be sustainable year-round.

## Results
- Out of a sample of 1,700 measurements, the mean temperature in June on Oahu was 74.9 degrees. The minimum temperature was 64, and the maximum temperature was 85 degrees. 
- Of the 1,517 temperature data points measured in December, the average temperature was 71 degrees with a standard deviation of 3.7.
- These results for both months suggest that the temperature on Oahu is fairly mild year-round with minimal variation between summer and winter. Based on this information, the client should consider Oahu the ideal location to open a surf and ice cream shop.

## Summary
The average temperature on the island of Oahu is in the mid to low 70s during June and December. Since these summary statistics describe a winter and summer month in the northern hemisphere, it is safe to assume there isn't much variation in the climate on the island year-round. To add more depth to this analysis, we could incorporate queries describing the temperature for the other months of the year. Furthermore, we could check to see the amount of rainfall that occurs each month on Oahu since it might affect the business's success.
